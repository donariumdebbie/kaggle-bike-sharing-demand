This repository contains a folder with given data from the competition and the kernels written by myself. 
The competition ended 4 years ago, so my results and rank are not what I have really achieved in the competition but the corresponding results and rank according to the leaderboard shown from the page. 


## [1] RandomForest_Baseline.ipynb

- EDA and feature engineering done
- Used RandomForestRegressor as a baseline model

### Results : public score 0.39513
### Rank : 185/3251 (top 5.69%)

## [2] RandomForest_Baseline2.ipynb

- Everything done same as [1], but I predicted 'casual' and 'registered' column separately and summed them to count for the final prediction. 

### Results : public score 0.38656
### Rank : 144/3251 (top 4.42%)
